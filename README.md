forKasparov
===========
I created this program for my buddy kasparov(hence the name for kasparov)
and I realised it would be usefull to many other people so i decided to share it
Sofar i have 
-bonus picking which rates which bonus you should spawn into or try to get next
-bonus estimating where you give the program bonuses and the armies a turn they provide
which helps for adding up numbers and keeping track of where the enemy is without history checking

I plan to add in more helpful features but none come to mind at the moment
